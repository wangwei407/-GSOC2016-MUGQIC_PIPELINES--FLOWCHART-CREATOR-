Before coming to U.S. I received my B.S. at Anhui University of Technology, China, in Information system program. Through my course studies and extra curriculum activities, I has built up solid programming backgrounds in aspects such as proficiency in coding and understanding with data structure and algorithm, and, more importantly, ability to analyze and solve problems.\r\n### Why I think my background qualifies me for this project.  \r\n* My solid background and considerable experience, with programming in general and python in specfic, has made it possible for me to analyze the source codes and understand the infrastructure of MUGQICPipeline soon enough;\r\n* I am able to perform operations in Unix/Linux environment for necessary system setup, development and testing work;\r\n* I have good experienced with Graphviz libraries and extensions, which seem to be a good solution alternative for the task objectives, and I hava demonstrated my knowledge with pipeline flowchart;\r\n* I have good experience with GIT version control system and specific source code collaboration hosts such as github and bitbucket.\r\n\r\n### Why I choose this project\r\n* I have big interest in strenghtening my development skills with Python, with production-level system development, and it would be a great experience to make that happen while making recognized contribution to a serious and functional project like MUGQICPipeline, which also makes considerable contribution to the field and to the world;\r\n* After studying the current implementation of MUGQICPipeline, I am impressed by how Python-based system could handle complicated cluster-fashion work flows for various users and groups. And I would definitely like to explore more in depth and learn from the people who make that happen;\r\n* The phylosophy of how MUGQICPipeline has been designed and implementated to handle various data integration and analysis demands is of great use for some of the future courses in my program;\r\n* The interaction with the mentor of this project is very positive.\r\n\r\n## Contact Information\r\n\r\nStudent name: Wei Wang\r\n\r\nMelange Link_id:  \r\n\r\nStudent postal address: 304N SKINKER BLVD, APT 3S, ST.LOUIS, MO, U.S.\r\n\r\nTelephone(s): +1 314-541-5129 or +86 139-3399-7555\r\n\r\nEmail(s): wangwei407@wustl.edu or wei0301wang@gmail.com\r\n\r\nOther communications channels: Skype/Google+, etc. : \r\n\r\n\r\n## Student Affiliation\r\n\r\nUniversity: Washington Univisity in St.Louis  \r\n\r\nSchool: School of Engineering & Applied Science\r\n\r\nProgram: M.S in Information System\r\n\r\nStage of completion: second year\r\n\r\nContact to verify: There is an automatically generated [PDF](http://52.36.214.116/~wangwei407/gsoc2016/Information.pdf) from my university account.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Schedule Conflicts\r\n\r\nThis summer, I don't have any other internships or plans, so I can contuibute all my time to this project.\r\n\r\n## Mentors\r\n\r\nMentor names: Johanna Sandoval\r\n\r\nMentor emails: johanna.sandoval@computationalgenomics.ca\r\n\r\nMentor link_ids: \r\n\r\nHave you been in touch with the mentors? When and how? \r\nYes, I have been in touch with the mentors Johanna and Mathieu through E-maill. And I have disscussed some technology issues with mentor Jonhanna, she gives me some very usefull directions and points about how to merge my module into the MUGQICPipeline software.\r\n\r\n## Synopsis (max 150 words)\r\nMUGQIC_PIPELINE program maintains 7 different kinds of pipelines and currently develops 3 others, and each of them contains 10 to 40 steps. My project is an integrated system which will automatically output flowchart based on different steps (e.g 1-20 or 1,4,9,11,20,21-30) and kinds of pipeline (e.g dnaseq,rnaseq) when pipeline is called.\r\n\r\n##  Benefits to Community (max 250 words)\r\nFlowchart creator is a user-friendly add-on to MUGQIC_PIPELINE. As metioned in **Synopsis**, MUGQIC_PIPELINE has many different kinds of pipelines and user can cnotrol aspects like steps ranges.On this perspective, a flowchart illustrating vital information makes MUGQIC_PIPELINE software more user-friendly and concrete. For example, flowchart contains start node (contains pipeline type,time and output path), step node (e.g. step1:convert BAM to FASTQ files), input/output node (e.g. BAM/FAST files) and action node (tell user what action dose the step do). \r\nMoreover, Flowchart creator engine can be called after pipeline is running. Then it can generate a more meticulous flowchart helping user to track the status of each step.\r\n\r\n## Coding Plan & Methods\r\nDescribe perceived obstacles and challenges, and how you plan to overcome them.\r\n###Coding objective:\r\nA Flowchart Creator Engine.\r\n###dependencies\r\n####[Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org)\r\nGraphviz is open source graph visualization software. Graph visualization is a way of representing structural information as diagrams of abstract graphs and networks. It has important applications in networking, bioinformatics,  software engineering, database and web design, machine learning, and in visual interfaces for other technical domains. \r\nGraphviz consists of a graph description language named the [DOT language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)) and a set of tools that can generate and/or process.\r\n**Why I choose Graphviz:**\r\n* Graphviz is a mature, stable, open-source,  free software. Though it is not a dedicated flowchart or diagramming creation tool, it's core use case, i.e, efficient and asethetic rendering of objects comprised of nodes and edges, obviously suits our project objectives;\r\n* Graphviz has it's own algorithm to automatically arrange nodes and edge.\r\n* Graphviz provides [many configurable attributes](http://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/attrs.html) to nodes, edges, subgraph. Such as color, size, font, style and url (e.g. When user click on the Trimmoatic node, flowchart will redirect user to trimmomatic [documentation](http://www.usadellab.org/cms/index.php?page=trimmomatic) website). These features make it more convenient and feasible to implement rich user-friendly functionalities and features in Flowchart Creator add-on.\r\n* Graphviz has defined a Domain Specific Language (DSL), i.e. DOT language, which is straightforward to depict directed graphs.\r\n* For example,  \r\n```dot\r\n  digraph G {  \r\n  \"MUGQIC PIPELINE START!\"->\"run step\"  \r\n  \"run step\"->\"END\"\r\n  }    \r\n  This is an easy directed graph contains 3 nodes, and two edges (-> connects two nodes)\r\n```\r\n> By employing DOT DSL, it allows great flexibility for Flowchart Creator add-on to manipulate Graphviz for diagram creation instead of being bound to specific binary releases.\r\n\r\n####[pydot](http://code.google.com/p/pydot/)\r\nA python binding to graphviz library  \r\n**Why I choose pydot**  \r\n* Pydot is an **open-source** and **light-weighted** python binding to graphviz. The mechanism of pydot is to transfer python code to DOT language and call Graphviz to output the graph.  \r\nFor example, use python module pydot to draw the graph    \r\n```python\r\nimport pydot  \r\nGraph=pydot.Dot() #create a dot object  \r\nedge1=pydot.Edge('MUGQIC PIPELINE START','run step')  #create a edge between node1 and node2  \r\nedge2=pydot.Edge('run step','END')  \r\nGraph.add_edge(edge1) #add edge1 to Graph  \r\nGraph.add_edge(edge2)  \r\nGraph.write_png('example.png') #output a png graph named 'example'  \r\n```\r\n![example.png](http://52.36.214.116/~wangwei407/gsoc2016/example.png)  \r\n\r\n#### Merge Graphviz and python module into MUGQICPipeline (Thanks to mentor Johanna giving me correct direction and clues)\r\n> Add pydot into resources.python_lib.sh and write a bash script Graphviz.sh to install Graphviz software in MUGQICPipeline software\r\n\r\n###Flowchart Creator API structure  (challenge) (Thanks to mentor Johanna giving me correct direction and clues)  \r\nI have observed that MUGQIC_PIPELINE software has 7 kinds of pipeline, and the pipeline class structures are as follows:    \r\n![classes.png](http://52.36.214.116/~wangwei407/gsoc2016/classes.png)\r\n**In this case, Flowchart Creator API will have 7 kinds of flowchart creator classes and has the same hierarchy as MUGQIC_PIPELINE:**  \r\n```python\r\n1. class MUGQICPipelineCreator  #base class for all creator class\r\n2. class IlluminaRunProcessingCreator(MUGQICPipelineCreator) #(match a pipeline tool)  \r\n3. class PacBioAssemblyCreator(MUGQICPipelineCreator)  #(match a pipeline tool)    \r\n4. class IlluminaCreator(MUGQICPipelineCreator) #This class is not a pipeline tool, but it is the parent class for DnaSeq, RnaSeq.    \r\n5. class DnaSeqCreator(IlluminaCreator)  #(match a pipeline tool)  \r\n6. class RnaSeqCreator(IlluminaCreator)  #(match a pipeline tool)  \r\n7. class RnaSeqDeNovoAssemblyCreator(IlluminaCreator)  #(match a pipeline tool)  \r\n8. class ChiSeqCreator(DnaSeqCreator) #(match a pipeline tool)  \r\n9. class DnaSeqHighCoverageCreator(DnaSeqCreator) #(match a pipeline tool)  \r\n10. class JobTracker() #This class is used in functionality 2.\r\n```\r\n> 1. Every Creator class which match a pipeline tool has the same function name related to the step function in pipeline tool. For example, in illumina class, there is a step function \"trimmomatic\" which clean FASTQ files so that there will be a function named tremmomatic in IlluminaCreator to draw a related action, input/output node for this step.What's more, if user run Flowchart Creator to draw a tack flowchart for steps, the function related steps will output a cluster to indicate step and job status.(See Functionality bellow)   \r\n2. Every Creator has a class method named draw_flowchart which receive a step name list and call self related functions to draw step nodes and connect them to output.  \r\n\r\n### Merge every Creator class into a callable factory class.\r\n#### Register every creator class and its related draw_flowchart function into a dict\r\n```python\r\nfrom abc import ABCMeta\r\nimport six\r\nCREATOR_CLASSES={}\r\nclass CreatorRegistry(ABCMeta):\r\n        '''\r\n        metaclass to define creator class\r\n        '''\r\n        registry = CREATOR_CLASSES\r\n        def __new__(mcls,name,bases,memebers):\r\n            cls=super(CreatorRegistry,mcls).__new__(mcls,name,bases,memebers)\r\n            if 'draw_flowchart' in memebers:\r\n                mcls.registry[cls.__name__]=cls.draw_flowchart #store class name and draw_flowchart function in a dict\r\n            return cls\r\n@six.add_metaclass(CreatorRegistry)\r\nclass MUGQICPipelineCreator:\r\n        pass\r\n```\r\n> In this case, CREATOR_CLASSES will store all class name(key) and related class method draw_flowchart function(value).\r\n\r\n#### Factory class to merge all Creator class callable  \r\n```python\r\nclass CreatorFactory:\r\n      def __init__(self,track_mode=True):\r\n         self.registry=CREATOR_CLASSES #pass the rigistry CREATOR_CLASSES into CreatorFactory class\r\n      def __call__(clsname,steps):  \r\n          '''\r\n          @param receive a class name and step object list\r\n          '''\r\n          return _check_class(clsname,steps)\r\n      def _check_class(clsname,steps): \r\n          self.parse_params(steps) \r\n          Then search self.registry to find out matched clsname and call its related draw_flowchart function to output flowchart\r\n      def parse_params(steps):\r\n          '''\r\n          transfer step object list to a step name (string) list\r\n          '''\r\n          pass  \r\nCreator=CreatorFactory(track_mode=False) #create a CreatorFactory object in order to merge Creator API to MUGQICPipeline Software. tack_mode=False means Flowchart Creator will output a overview flowchart as soon as Pipeline starts.\r\n```\r\n#### Merge Creator API into MUGQICPipeline software\r\nI have observed in core.Pipeline class init() function: \r\n```python\r\n104.            if self.args.steps:\r\n105.                if re.search(\"^\\d+([,-]\\d+)*$\", self.args.steps):\r\n106.                    self._step_range = [self.step_list[i - 1] for i in parse_range(self.args.steps)]\r\n107.                else:\r\n108.                    raise Exception(\"Error: step range \\\"\" + self.args.steps +\r\n109.                        \"\\\" is invalid (should match \\d+([,-]\\d+)*)!\")\r\n110.            else:\r\n111.                self.argparser.error(\"argument -s/--steps is required!\")\r\n```\r\n> ``` self._step_range```is a parsed step object list. In this case, just add ```from CreatorFactory import Creator``` to the header and pass ```self._step_range and class name```to Creator. Like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n104.            if self.args.steps:\r\n105.                if re.search(\"^\\d+([,-]\\d+)*$\", self.args.steps):\r\n106.                    self._step_range = [self.step_list[i - 1] for i in parse_range(self.args.steps)]\r\n107.                else:\r\n108.                    raise Exception(\"Error: step range \\\"\" + self.args.steps +\r\n109.                        \"\\\" is invalid (should match \\d+([,-]\\d+)*)!\")\r\n110.            else:\r\n111.                self.argparser.error(\"argument -s/--steps is required!\")\r\n112.            Creator(self.__class__.__name__, self._step_range) #pass class name and step object list to Creator\r\n```\r\n> In this case, My Creator Factory API has merged into MUGQICPipeline software, and it can output flowchart automatically when pipeline tool is called. **Or it can be added into self.args, which makes user to control whether or not to output an overview flowchart**\r\n\r\n###Functionality: \r\n#####As described above, one of the functionalities for the flowchart creator is to output an overview step information(step sequence, name, input, output)flowchart as soon as pipeline runs. \r\n#####Another more important functionality is to output a flowchart which makes user more easiler to track the status of step.  \r\n> MUGQICPipeline is an excellent and complex pipeline tool. And it consists of steps which are controlled by user. \r\nMUGQICPipeline has a robust log analysis system. For example,[[1]](https://bitbucket.org/mugqic/mugqic_pipelines/overview#markdown-header-pbs-job-logs) when pipelines are run in PBS (Portable Batch System) job scheduler mode (default), a job list file is created in ```<output_dir>/job_output/<PipelineName>_job_list_<timestamp>```  and subsequent job log files are placed in   ```<output_dir>/job_output/<step_name>/<job_name>_<timestamp>.o```. \r\n\r\n**In view of this situation, I design a mechanism to track the procedure of pipeline and output a detailed flowchart as follows:**  \r\n\r\n1. When user types command on the shell:  \r\n     ```\r\n     ./FlowchartCreator.py out_dir\r\n     ```  \r\n2. Flowchart Creator engine will call```$MUGQIC_PIPELINES_HOME/utils/log_report.pl <output_dir>/job_output/<PipelineName>_job_list_<timestamp> > flowchart.tsv``` to create a log report like [this example.tsv](http://52.36.214.116/~wangwei407/gsoc2016/example.tsv).  \r\n3. Flowchart Creator engine call class JobTracker to parse and classify output from step 1. \r\n\r\n  >  For example, a row of the output from step 1 is as follows:\r\n  ```\r\n  #JOB_ID JOB_FULL_ID    JOB_NAME    JOB_DEPENDENCIES    STATUS    JOB_EXIT_CODE    CMD_EXIT_CODE    REAL_TIME    START_DATE    END_DATE    CPU_TIME    CPU_REAL_TIME_RATIO    PHYSICAL_MEM    VIRTUAL_MEM    EXTRA_VIRTUAL_MEM_PCT    LIMITS    QUEUE    USERNAME    GROUP    SESSION    ACCOUNT    NODES    PATH  \r\n  2100213.abacus2.ferrier.genome.mcgill.ca    2100213.abacus2.ferrier.genome.mcgill.ca    trimmomatic.readset1    SUCCESS    N/A    0    01:08:45 (1 h 8 min 45 s)    2014-09-30T19:52:58    2014-09-30T21:01:48    02:39:34 (2 h 39 min 34 s)    2.32    1.71 GiB    3.73 GiB    118.2 %    neednodes=1:ppn=6,nodes=1:ppn=6,walltime=24:00:00    sw    jfillon analyste    2465764    N/A    f3c10    /path/to/output_dir/job_output/trimmomatic/trimmomatic.readset1_2014-09-30T19.52.29.o  \r\n  ```\r\nJobTracker class will extract ```JOB_NAME, STATUS, JOB_EXIT_CODE, CMD_EXIT_CODE, START_DATE, CPU_TIME ``` data from output file and classfy jobs by steps. For example, JOB_NAME=trimmomatic.readset1 belongs to step trimmomatic.  \r\n\r\n4.  Then JobTracker will summerize and operate these data. At last, pass opearted data to class CreatorFactory to draw flowchart graph.  \r\n    > **In addition, there are some rules to output**:  \r\n       * If all jobs of a step are success or failed, the status of the step is finished.  \r\n       * If there exists a job of a step is active or inactive, the status of the step is not finished.  \r\n       * All steps will output numbers of jobs.  \r\n       * Finished steps will output numbers of success of jobs, numbers of failed jobs, and cpu_time.  \r\n       * Not finished steps will output numbers of success jobs, numbers of failed jobs, numbers of active and inactive jobs and % progress(finished jobs/total jobs).  \r\n5.  Clean some useless files such as flowchart.tsv.  \r\n6.  Open output flowchart(optional)\r\n\r\n###Expected outcome \r\n#### Flowchart legend for JobTracker flowchart\r\nDiamond for unfinshed step, box shape for finished step.\r\n####  When user want to track the status of pipeline steps and output a flowchart, the output will looks like:\r\n![expected.png](http://52.36.214.116/~wangwei407/gsoc2016/expected.png)\r\nOr if necessary, I can add action node and input node to the flowchart which looks like:\r\n![expected2.png](http://52.36.214.116/~wangwei407/gsoc2016/expected2.png)\r\n###Flowchart legend for overview flowchart  \r\n**input/output node**  \r\n####![input.png](http://52.36.214.116/~wangwei407/gsoc2016/input.png)\r\n**start/end node**  \r\n####![start.png](http://52.36.214.116/~wangwei407/gsoc2016/step.png)\r\n**action node**  \r\n####![action.png](http://52.36.214.116/~wangwei407/gsoc2016/action.png)\r\n\r\n#### Overview pipeline output for **Selection tests**  \r\nImplement a test flochart in python for 5 first step of the DNAseq pipeline.\r\nthe corresponding step are:  \r\n1. picard_sam_to_fastq => generate fastq files from bam files  \r\n2. trimmomatic => clean fastq files  \r\n3. merge_trimmomatic_stats => merge individuals cleaning metrics  \r\n4. bwa_mem_picard_sort_sam => generate bam files from fastq files  \r\n5. picard_merge_sam_files => merge individuals bam files  \r\n#### When user just want to check out the overview steps for pipeline, it will looks like:\r\n##### My flowchart Creator can arrange output in different directions  \r\n1.

I can test my API on local. And I will report test files to mentor and upload to my branch.\r\n* When I finished the whole API, I will make a pull request to MUGQICPipeline repository.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Test\r\n#### Test Class for overview pipeline creator:\r\n* Randomly generate two ouput:  \r\n  1. class name for pipeline type. (e.g. DnaSeq,RnaSeq)    \r\n  2. step object sequence list. For example, step[1,2,3,5,6,7,10,20]  \r\n* Then pass the output to Creator API.\r\n* Get the return of Creator API.\r\n* Check whether or not the class name is matched.\r\n* Check whether or not the step output sequence is matched and correct.\r\n* Check whether the step is out of range for pipeline. (e.g. ChiSeq has total 15 steps if Creator receive a step list[1,2,3,4,16] it will raise an out of step range exception)\r\n\r\n#### Test Class for JobTracker pipeline creator:\r\n* It will designed and implemented when JobTracker class is finished.\r\n* The expected outcomes for JobTracker is to parse the right sequence of steps and correct numbers of jobs(success, failed, inactive, active).\r\n\r\n## Anything Else\r\nIt is just a tentative proposal.If I were luckey to be selected as a member of MUGQICPipeline team member, I would discuss some details with team members and mentors.\r\n\r\n",
