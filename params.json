The application process is longer this year than it has been in some prior years, so this should not be a problem.\r\n\r\n* Be sure to follow the general guidelines available in the [GSoC student guide](http://write.flossmanuals.net/gsocstudentguide/writing-a-proposal/).\r\n\r\n* If you have questions about details, contact your mentors first.  If you still have choices to make or different possible approaches, explore the most likely ones in your application. The goal of your application is to demonstrate your capability to complete the work of the project over the course of the summer, demonstrate that you've given a fair amount of thought to an implementation approach, and plan, as much as possible, for choices that may change the goals or timeline in the application.\r\n\r\n* Once your draft application has been submitted, you may receive comments from other C3G mentors, either listed project mentors or others.  Please respond to the comments promptly and completely.  Being non-responsive before you've even been awarded a slot is not a good sign for the success of your proposal.\r\n\r\n* Originality is always welcomed. If you have improvement ideas that go beyong the proposed project scope, by all means include them in your proposal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Project Info\r\n\r\nProject title: **Flowchart creator for MUGQIC Pipelines**  \r\nProject short title (30 characters): **Flowchart creator**  \r\nURL of project idea page: [idea link](https://bitbucket.org/mugqic/gsoc2016#markdown-header-flowchart-creator-for-mugqic-pipelines)  \r\n## Biographical Information  \r\nI am a graduate student at [Washington University in St.Louis](http://wustl.edu), pursuing Master in Information System for Big Data and Predictive Analytics Track. Before coming to U.S. I received my B.S. at Anhui University of Technology, China, in Information system program. Through my course studies and extra curriculum activities, I has built up solid programming backgrounds in aspects such as proficiency in coding and understanding with data structure and algorithm, and, more importantly, ability to analyze and solve problems.\r\n### Why I think my background qualifies me for this project.  \r\n* My solid background and considerable experience, with programming in general and python in specfic, has made it possible for me to analyze the source codes and understand the infrastructure of MUGQICPipeline soon enough;\r\n* I am able to perform operations in Unix/Linux environment for necessary system setup, development and testing work;\r\n* I have good experienced with Graphviz libraries and extensions, which seem to be a good solution alternative for the task objectives, and I hava demonstrated my knowledge with pipeline flowchart;\r\n* I have good experience with GIT version control system and specific source code collaboration hosts such as github and bitbucket.\r\n\r\n### Why I choose this project\r\n* I have big interest in strenghtening my development skills with Python, with production-level system development, and it would be a great experience to make that happen while making recognized contribution to a serious and functional project like MUGQICPipeline, which also makes considerable contribution to the field and to the world;\r\n* After studying the current implementation of MUGQICPipeline, I am impressed by how Python-based system could handle complicated cluster-fashion work flows for various users and groups. And I would definitely like to explore more in depth and learn from the people who make that happen;\r\n* The phylosophy of how MUGQICPipeline has been designed and implementated to handle various data integration and analysis demands is of great use for some of the future courses in my program;\r\n* The interaction with the mentor of this project is very positive.\r\n\r\n## Contact Information\r\n\r\nStudent name: Wei Wang\r\n\r\nMelange Link_id:  \r\n\r\nStudent postal address: 304N SKINKER BLVD, APT 3S, ST.LOUIS, MO, U.S.\r\n\r\nTelephone(s): +1 314-541-5129 or +86 139-3399-7555\r\n\r\nEmail(s): wangwei407@wustl.edu or wei0301wang@gmail.com\r\n\r\nOther communications channels: Skype/Google+, etc. : \r\n\r\n\r\n## Student Affiliation\r\n\r\nUniversity: Washington Univisity in St.Louis  \r\n\r\nSchool: School of Engineering & Applied Science\r\n\r\nProgram: M.S in Information System\r\n\r\nStage of completion: second year\r\n\r\nContact to verify: There is an automatically generated [PDF](http://52.36.214.116/~wangwei407/gsoc2016/Information.pdf) from my university account.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Schedule Conflicts\r\n\r\nThis summer, I don't have any other internships or plans, so I can contuibute all my time to this project.\r\n\r\n## Mentors\r\n\r\nMentor names: Johanna Sandoval\r\n\r\nMentor emails: johanna.sandoval@computationalgenomics.ca\r\n\r\nMentor link_ids: \r\n\r\nHave you been in touch with the mentors? When and how? \r\nYes, I have been in touch with the mentors Johanna and Mathieu through E-maill. And I have disscussed some technology issues with mentor Jonhanna, she gives me some very usefull directions and points about how to merge my module into the MUGQICPipeline software.\r\n\r\n## Synopsis (max 150 words)\r\nMUGQIC_PIPELINE program maintains 7 different kinds of pipelines and currently develops 3 others, and each of them contains 10 to 40 steps. My project is an integrated system which will automatically output flowchart based on different steps (e.g 1-20 or 1,4,9,11,20,21-30) and kinds of pipeline (e.g dnaseq,rnaseq) when pipeline is called.\r\n\r\n##  Benefits to Community (max 250 words)\r\nFlowchart creator is a user-friendly add-on to MUGQIC_PIPELINE. As metioned in **Synopsis**, MUGQIC_PIPELINE has many different kinds of pipelines and user can cnotrol aspects like steps ranges.On this perspective, a flowchart illustrating vital information makes MUGQIC_PIPELINE software more user-friendly and concrete. For example, flowchart contains start node (contains pipeline type,time and output path), step node (e.g. step1:convert BAM to FASTQ files), input/output node (e.g. BAM/FAST files) and action node (tell user what action dose the step do). \r\nMoreover, I will design and introduce an integrated Flowchart creator API in pipeline base class so that it will alleviate the requirment to change the pipeline class for adding new type of pipelines in future. \r\n\r\n## Coding Plan & Methods\r\nDescribe perceived obstacles and challenges, and how you plan to overcome them.\r\n###Coding objective:\r\nA Flowchart Creator API which is merged into pipeline base class.\r\n###dependencies\r\n####[Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org)\r\nGraphviz is open source graph visualization software. Graph visualization is a way of representing structural information as diagrams of abstract graphs and networks. It has important applications in networking, bioinformatics,  software engineering, database and web design, machine learning, and in visual interfaces for other technical domains. \r\nGraphviz consists of a graph description language named the [DOT language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)) and a set of tools that can generate and/or process.\r\n**Why I choose Graphviz:**\r\n* Graphviz is a mature, stable, open-source,  free software. Though it is not a dedicated flowchart or diagramming creation tool, it's core use case, i.e, efficient and asethetic rendering of objects comprised of nodes and edges, obviously suits our project objectives;\r\n* Graphviz has it's own algorithm to automatically arrange nodes and edge.\r\n* Graphviz provides [many configurable attributes](http://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/attrs.html) to nodes, edges, subgraph. Such as color, size, font, style and url (e.g. When user click on the Trimmoatic node, flowchart will redirect user to trimmomatic [documentation](http://www.usadellab.org/cms/index.php?page=trimmomatic) website). These features make it more convenient and feasible to implement rich user-friendly functionalities and features in Flowchart Creator add-on.\r\n* Graphviz has defined a Domain Specific Language (DSL), i.e. DOT language, which is straightforward to depict directed graphs.\r\n* For example,  \r\n```dot\r\n  digraph G {  \r\n  \"MUGQIC PIPELINE START!\"->\"run step\"  \r\n  \"run step\"->\"END\"\r\n  }    \r\n  This is an easy directed graph contains 3 nodes, and two edges (-> connects two nodes)\r\n```\r\n> By employing DOT DSL, it allows great flexibility for Flowchart Creator add-on to manipulate Graphviz for diagram creation instead of being bound to specific binary releases.\r\n\r\n####[pydot](http://code.google.com/p/pydot/)\r\nA python binding to graphviz library  \r\n**Why I choose pydot**  \r\n* Pydot is an **open-source** and **light-weighted** python binding to graphviz. The mechanism of pydot is to transfer python code to DOT language and call Graphviz to output the graph.  \r\nFor example, use python module pydot to draw the graph    \r\n```python\r\nimport pydot  \r\nGraph=pydot.Dot() #create a dot object  \r\nedge1=pydot.Edge('MUGQIC PIPELINE START','run step')  #create a edge between node1 and node2  \r\nedge2=pydot.Edge('run step','END')  \r\nGraph.add_edge(edge1) #add edge1 to Graph  \r\nGraph.add_edge(edge2)  \r\nGraph.write_png('example.png') #output a png graph named 'example'  \r\n```\r\n![example.png](http://52.36.214.116/~wangwei407/gsoc2016/example.png)  \r\n\r\n#### Merge Graphviz and python module into MUGQICPipeline (Thanks to mentor Johanna giving me correct direction and clues)\r\n> Add pydot into resources.python_lib.sh and write a bash script Graphviz.sh to install Graphviz software in MUGQICPipeline software\r\n\r\n###Flowchart Creator API structure  (challenge) (Thanks to mentor Johanna giving me correct direction and clues)  \r\nI have observed that MUGQIC_PIPELINE software has 7 kinds of pipeline, and the pipeline class structures are as follows:    \r\n![class.png](http://52.36.214.116/~wangwei407/gsoc2016/class.png)  \r\n**In this case, Flowchart Creator API will have 7 kinds of flowchart creator classes and has the same hierarchy as MUGQIC_PIPELINE:**  \r\n```python\r\n1. class MUGQICPipelineCreator  #base class for all creator class\r\n2. class IlluminaRunProcessingCreator(MUGQICPipelineCreator) #(match a pipeline tool)  \r\n3. class BioAssemblyPacoCreator(MUGQICPipelineCreator)  #(match a pipeline tool)    \r\n4. class IlluminaCreator(MUGQICPipelineCreator) #This class is not a pipeline tool, but it is the parent class for DnaSeq, RnaSeq.    \r\n5. class DnaSeqCreator(IlluminaCreator)  #(match a pipeline tool)  \r\n6. class RnaSeqCreator(IlluminaCreator)  #(match a pipeline tool)  \r\n7. class RnaSeqDeNovoAssemblyCreator(IlluminaCreator)  #(match a pipeline tool)  \r\n8. class ChiSeqCreator(DnaSeqCreator) #(match a pipeline tool)  \r\n9. class DnaSeqHighCoverageCreator(DnaSeqCreator) #(match a pipeline tool)  \r\n```\r\n> 1. Every Creator class which match a pipeline tool has the same function name related to the step function in pipeline tool. For example, in illumina class, there is a step function \"trimmomatic\" which clean FASTQ files so that there will be a function named tremmomatic in IlluminaCreator to draw a related action, input/output node for this step.  \r\n2. Every Creator has a class method named draw_flowchart which receive a step name list and call self related functions to draw step nodes and connect them to output.  \r\n\r\n### Merge every Creator class into a callable factory class.\r\n#### Register every creator class and its related draw_flowchart function into a dict\r\n```python\r\nfrom abc import ABCMeta\r\nimport six\r\nCREATOR_CLASSES={}\r\nclass CreatorRegistry(ABCMeta):\r\n        '''\r\n        metaclass to define creator class\r\n        '''\r\n        registry = CREATOR_CLASSES\r\n        def __new__(mcls,name,bases,memebers):\r\n            cls=super(CreatorRegistry,mcls).__new__(mcls,name,bases,memebers)\r\n            if 'draw_flowchart' in memebers:\r\n                mcls.registry[cls.__name__]=cls.draw_flowchart #store class name and draw_flowchart function in a dict\r\n            return cls\r\n@six.add_metaclass(CreatorRegistry)\r\nclass MUGQICPipelineCreator:\r\n        pass\r\n```\r\n> In this case, CREATOR_CLASSES will store all class name(key) and related class method draw_flowchart function(value).\r\n\r\n#### Factory class to merge all Creator class callable  \r\n```python\r\nclass CreatorFactory:\r\n      def __init__(self):\r\n         self.registry=CREATOR_CLASSES #pass the rigistry CREATOR_CLASSES into CreatorFactory class\r\n      def __call__(clsname,steps):  \r\n          '''\r\n          @param receive a class name and step object list\r\n          '''\r\n          return _check_class(clsname,steps)\r\n      def _check_class(clsname,steps): \r\n          self.parse_params(steps) \r\n          Then search self.registry to find out matched clsname and call its related draw_flowchart function to output flowchart\r\n      def parse_params(steps):\r\n          '''\r\n          transfer step object list to a step name (string) list\r\n          '''\r\n          pass  \r\nCreator=CreatorFactory() #create a CreatorFactory object in order to merge Creator API to MUGQICPipeline Software\r\n```\r\n#### Merge Creator API into MUGQICPipeline software\r\nI have observed in core.Pipeline class init() function: \r\n```python\r\n104.            if self.args.steps:\r\n105.                if re.search(\"^\\d+([,-]\\d+)*$\", self.args.steps):\r\n106.                    self._step_range = [self.step_list[i - 1] for i in parse_range(self.args.steps)]\r\n107.                else:\r\n108.                    raise Exception(\"Error: step range \\\"\" + self.args.steps +\r\n109.                        \"\\\" is invalid (should match \\d+([,-]\\d+)*)!\")\r\n110.            else:\r\n111.                self.argparser.error(\"argument -s/--steps is required!\")\r\n```\r\n> ``` self._step_range```is a parsed step object list. In this case, just add ```from CreatorFactory import Creator``` to the header and pass ```self._step_range and class name```to Creator. Like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n104.            if self.args.steps:\r\n105.                if re.search(\"^\\d+([,-]\\d+)*$\", self.args.steps):\r\n106.                    self._step_range = [self.step_list[i - 1] for i in parse_range(self.args.steps)]\r\n107.                else:\r\n108.                    raise Exception(\"Error: step range \\\"\" + self.args.steps +\r\n109.                        \"\\\" is invalid (should match \\d+([,-]\\d+)*)!\")\r\n110.            else:\r\n111.                self.argparser.error(\"argument -s/--steps is required!\")\r\n112.            Creator(self.__class__.__name__, self._step_range) #pass class name and step object list to Creator\r\n```\r\n> In this case, My Creator Factory API has merged into MUGQICPipeline software, and it can output flowchart automatically when pipeline tool is called. \r\n\r\n###Flowchart legend for MUGQIC_PIPELINES  \r\n**input/output node**  \r\n####![input.png](http://52.36.214.116/~wangwei407/gsoc2016/input.png)\r\n**start/end node**  \r\n####![start.png](http://52.36.214.116/~wangwei407/gsoc2016/step.png)\r\n**action node**  \r\n####![action.png](http://52.36.214.116/~wangwei407/gsoc2016/action.png)\r\n###Flowchart expected outcome(selection test)  \r\n####**Selection tests**  \r\nImplement a test flochart in python for 5 first step of the DNAseq pipeline.\r\nthe corresponding step are:  \r\n1. picard_sam_to_fastq => generate fastq files from bam files  \r\n2. trimmomatic => clean fastq files  \r\n3. merge_trimmomatic_stats => merge individuals cleaning metrics  \r\n4. bwa_mem_picard_sort_sam => generate bam files from fastq files  \r\n5. picard_merge_sam_files => merge individuals bam files  \r\n#####**My flowchart output**  \r\n##### My flowchart Creator can arrange output in different directions  \r\n1.
